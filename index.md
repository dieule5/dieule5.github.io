hi, my name is dieu and I'm a second yr physics undergrad living in minneapolis! 

written for my future self and shared publicly. some entries are academic, others more exploratory, w/ many fun facts, all written as I learn one step at a time. my mission is to learn openly and grow.

signed,<br/>dieu
